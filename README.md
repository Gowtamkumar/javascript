𝟮. 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗺𝗶𝘀𝗲𝘀: These are objects representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation.

𝟯. 𝗔𝘀𝘆𝗻𝗰/𝗔𝘄𝗮𝗶𝘁: This is syntactic sugar for Promises, making asynchronous code look and behave like synchronous code.

𝟰. 𝗦𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗰𝘁 𝗠𝗼𝗱𝗲: This is a way to opt into a restricted variant of JavaScript, reducing errors and making code safer.

𝟱. 𝗛𝗶𝗴𝗵𝗲𝗿-𝗢𝗿𝗱𝗲𝗿 𝗙𝘂𝗻𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀: These are functions that operate on other functions, either by taking them as arguments or returning them.
